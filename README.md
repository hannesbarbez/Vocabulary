# About

Most likely, you want to practice some vocabulary when learning a new language. Vocabulary++ can help you to better study a foreign language and its vocabulary. Test your knowledge with the vocabulary lists you downloaded or created yourself. Vocabulary++ is an easy-to-use, yet effective tool that will assist you doing exactly this: 

- Define and input a vocabulary list or open a previously saved one; 
- Interrogate yourself from native to new language â€“ and vice-versa using the exam/test function; 
- Randomize a test for added difficulty. Vocabulary++ word lists are saved in XML format (with extension *.vocab), and allows for maximal potential compatitibility with other apps.
