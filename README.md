## About

Most likely, you want to practice some vocabulary when learning a new language. Vocabulary++ helps you better study the vocabulary of a foreign language. Test your knowledge with vocabulary lists you downloaded or created yourself. Vocabulary++ is easy-to-use, effective tool that will help you achieve the following: 

- Define and input a vocabulary list or open a previously saved one; 
- Interrogate yourself from native to new language â€“ and vice-versa using the exam/test function;
